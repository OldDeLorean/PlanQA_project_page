# PlanQA Project Page

This repository contains the source code for the PlanQA project webpage.
The page is inspired by the [Nerfies](https://nerfies.github.io/) template.

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the page. The `images/` directory is
empty so you can add your own images. Place nine PNG files named
`img1.png`&ndash;`img9.png` inside the folder to populate the gallery.
